## Basics of the POSIX CLI (command line interface for n00bs)

1.    DONT DO THIS: `rm -rf /` (this means delete everything)
2.    `ssh webadmin@1.2.3.4` (gets you into a server)
3.    `mkdir hello` (make a directory called hello)
4.    `cd hello` (changes your directory to hello, assumes it has been created)
5.    `pwd` (prints path)
6.    `rm your-filename-here` (remove filename (BE CAREFUL!)
7.    `rmdir` - remove directory, if empty
8.    `rm -rf directory/xyz` (removes whole directory with stuff in it)
9.    `rm *.php` (removes all files of that type in one directory)
10.    `man your--program-here` (shows you manual for that part)
11.    `cd ..` (jumps you back a directory)
12.    `cd ../..` (jumps you back two directories)
13.    `cd` (jumps you back to the home directory)
13.    `cd ./whatever/you/want` (relative link with that dot in the front)
14.    `cd /` (take you to the root directory)
15.    `cd /home/your-username-here` (!where you are!)
16.    `mv /path/goes/here/filename /path/goes/here/your-file-name-2`  (mv moves a file)
17.    `cp /path/goes/here/filename /path/goes/here/your-file-name-2` (copies file in same folder)
18.    `cp -a /path/goes/here/. /path/goes/here/` (copies the contents of an existing folder into a previously defined folder)
19.    try to put a first letter on the line, then use TAB key and it tries to autocomplete - nice!
20.    `find -name hosts` (get)
21.    `sudo` (switch user, do xyz...)
22.    `/etc/hosts` (where the host file lives)
23.    `/etc/init/d` (the folder usually the daemon to start programs live)
24.    `/etc/init.d/sendmail start` (starts mail on server)
25.    `~/` (Shortcut to go home directory of a given user)
26.    `Control + C` (kills the process on the command line)
27.    `Command + K` (OSX clears Bash cache)
28.    `Control + L` (clears the terminal window)
29.    `gzip PATH-HERE` - gzips a file for you, which is what phpmyadmin seems to like
30.    `mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME < MYDATABASE.sql` (imports a DB)
31.    `host your-domain-here` (shows you how the DNS resolves)
32.    `shift+control+v` (paste into terminal, OSX)
33.    `chmod +x or chmod 777` (execute permission to make scripts happen)
34.    `cd ~/.ssh` (see if you have ssh keys installed)
35.    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@host.com"` (installs SSH keys - needed for git transactions and other stuff)
36.    `source .your-dot-file-here` (this refreshes the file, makes life great)
37.    `sudo your-samba-passwd-here -a quickstart` (changes samba password, allows websites folder in quickstart to appear in mac os x finder)
38.    `ssh your-user-name-here@your-ip-address-here` (logs you into an SSH session)
39.    `ssh root@192.###.###.###` (gives you shell access to a server, will prompt for shell password)
40.    `hostname` (prints your computer's hostname - Linux)
41.    `exit` (logs you out of an SSH session)
42.    `su - username` (switches user to username)
43.    `clear` (erases output in terminal window)
44.    `sudo smbpasswd -a your-name-here` (changes your samba password for file transfer between OSes, good for virtual machines)
45.    `sudo service smbd restart` (restarts samba)
46.    `rvm --default use 2.0.0` (forces Mac OSX to permanently use a newer version of Ruby)
47.    `rvm --default use rubygems 2.0.03` (forces Mac OSX to permantenly use new rubygems - necessary to run Jekyll/Octopress, probably outdated in 2017 but made sense in 2012)
48.    `sudo reboot` (restarts your machine)
49.    `sudo poweroff` (turns off your machine)
50.    `scutil --get HostName` (prints your computer's hostname - OSX)
51.    `scutil --set HostName your-name-hostname-here` (changes your computer's hostname - OSX)
52.    `df` (gives you a readout of the disk space your system has available)
53.    `pwd | pbcopy` (copies your current path in OSX only)
54.    `xcode-select --install` (installs command line tools for xcode - only necessary on osx 10.8 and down, comes standard on osx 10.9 and up)
55.    `chrome://flags` (IN BROWSER WINDOW, NOT COMMAND LINE - you play with chrome's plumbing, like disabling that stupid notifications center that tacked into OSX)
56.    If you install node.js, put it here: `/usr/local/bin/npm`
57.    `npm install -g yo` (if you have node.js, this installs yeoman, bower and grunt)
58.    `npm install -g generator-webapp` (puts scaffolding in for creating webapps)
59.	   `sudo chown your-user-name-here /usr/local/your/root/path/here` (changes ownership of various files via CLI)
60.    `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (copies something to your clipboard, so you can paste it like a human being - only in OSX. This example copies your SSH key.)
61.    `cat` - concatenate the key (for example, cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ), prints my ssh key
62.    `/etc` (is a symlink to /private/etc - Mac OSX sets this up natively)
63.    `/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` (where the Mac OSX native apache files live)
64.    `wget -mirror $url` (replicates site in your local folder - whichever folder you run the command from)
65.    `gpasswd -a username-here sudo` (adds a user to sudo group, must be `root`)
66.    `adduser username` (adds user to ubuntu)

69.    `<Return> ~ .` (kills an open ssh session)
70.    `service mysqld start` (starts up the mysql server, assumes mysql is installed on the box)
71.    `ls` (spits out list of directory view)
72.    `scp -r /Users/username-here/desktop/source ssh-username-here@ftp.domain.com:/home/user/public_html/dir/destination` (scp securely copies a directory from one place to another - the directory on the left is the SOURCE, the right is the DESTINATION)
73.    `pwd | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy` (copies command line path in OSX - h/t: bradlanders.com) - make an alias of this so its less crazy next time: alias cpwd="pwd | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy"
74.    `cpwd` (will copy a path to your clipboard, after you make the alias in the above step - aliases will only work locally - YOUVE BEEN WARNED!)
75.    `service httpd start` (starts your apache server, assumes apache is installed on the box)
76.    `ssh -p #### username-here@server-name-here` (connect to a specific port (non-22) on a ssh server)
77.    `htpasswd -c /user/your-name-here/domain.com/.htpasswd admin` (sets up the encrypted .htpasswd file youll need to password protect your apache-based server - will prompt for password, assumes you have apache 2.x installed on your server)
78.    `tar -cvzf youfilename-here-dump.tar.gz /home/your/path/here` (tars up a directory for you)  
79.    `ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink` (links file to a path with symlink)
80.    `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | awk '/ SSID/ {print substr($0, index($0, $2))}'` (OSX ONLY! - gets you the SSID of the wireless network you are on)
81.    `/var/www/html or /usr/local/apache/htdocs` (This is where your website should/could live on a linux server. Paths are from the root)
82.    `cd "Foldername with a Space"` (must use quotes to espace space characters on the command line)
83.    `cd volumes` (access remote drives - if already mounted, they will be at volumes/drive-name-nere)
84.    `ls -a` (shows list of files in your directory, including hidden dot files)
85.    `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out star_example_com.csr -keyout star_example_com.pem -subj "/C=country-code-here/ST=state-code-here/L=city-here/O=organization-here/OU=organization-dept-here/CN=*.example.com/emailAddress=team@example.com"` (openssl command to generate a self-signed certificate and private key, note the CN part of command must match the type of SSL cert you need, single or multi-domain)
86.    `sudo easy_install pip` (installs pip, package manager for python)
